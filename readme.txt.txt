1. How we have Designed the game?
To Design the Game we used Unity Game Engine, and GIMP simulation tools to edit and make the assets we also used Quad Architecture with C# Scripts. 


2. What architecture did we use? How we created the art, and from where did we source the art assets? Who created the art?
We used QUAD Architecture to design the game
We first imported all assets in one place then created the panel, and quad for background scrolling, and then created all the movement scripts along with the meteor spawn and then input all the destroy object scripts, after fixing some bugs we build the game. We searched use the assets store for the assets, used the GIMP Simulation tool and used the opengameart.org  site for the animation, The Art was created by Maanav Shinde of our team (Rustage-Creed).




3. What is the future scope of the game? Can you see it becoming a multiplayer game? If yes how?
In future, the final boss can be added and more power-ups along with different levels can be added, as the game progresses more power-ups will be enabled and players will have more options to choose from also we can increase the duration of power-ups by hitting with laser.
Yes, it can become a multiplayer game in two ways. The first way is by splitting the screen into two-half in which two players can play and a higher score will be displayed or we can load two scenes in which the players will play turn by turn and the the one who score high wins. The second way is the player can create their own server and they can join each other on the server to take on the different planet bosses.
